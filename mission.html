        FlameGuard began with a simple mission -- to help our community in a time in which AI is mistakenly viewed as something to be feared. We strive to create something that impacts our community on a quantifiable scale to improve how the general public regards AI. 
        As we continue to move into the future, we want to help people wherever we can with rapidly changing technology.
